<!-- (1)'var' declarations are globally scoped or function scoped while 'let' and 'const' are block scoped.
    (2)'var' variables can be updated and re-declared within its scope; 'let' variables can be updated but not re-declared; 'const' variables can neither be updated nor re-declared.
    (3) They are all hoisted to the top of their scope but while 'var' variables are initialized with undefined, 'let' and 'const' variables are not initialized.
    (4)While 'var' and 'let' can be declared without being initialized, 'const' must be initialized during declaration.
